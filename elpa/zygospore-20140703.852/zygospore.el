;;; Commentary:

;; Press C-x 1 again to restore windows!

;; Install:
;; Test it out with M-x zygospore-toggle-delete-other-windows RET (twice, on a frame with multiple windows)

;; To make it permanent, add this line to your init.el:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 1") 'zygospore-toggle-delete-other-windows)

;;; Code:

(defvar zygospore-spore-formation-register-name

  "Name of the register that zygospore uses to reverse `zygospore-delete-other-windows'.")

(defvar zygospore-last-full-frame-window

(defvar zygospore-last-full-frame-buffer
  nil
